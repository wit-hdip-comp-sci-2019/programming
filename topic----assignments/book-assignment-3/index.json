Open it inside your IntelliJ environment.\n\n![][skeleton]\n\n\n###Code `src/main`   \nYou are required to develop the application code in the classes of the `src/main` folder. Some classes already contain initial code to help you get started - although this code is incomplete. \n\n###Test `src/test`   \nUnit test code is stored in the `src/test` folder, which will be provided incrementally (via Slack)  over the duration of the assignment. \n\nYou shouldn't modify the tests, modify your code to meet the tests. In correcting your assignment we will replace whatever is in your test folder with the published tests.   \n\n\n[arch]: ./img/arch.jpg\n[start]: ./archives/start.zip\n[skeleton]: ./img/skeleton.png"

    "contentMd" : "##Data model\n\n###Requirements\n\nThe app's data model consists of the following entities: \n\n+ Premium Member\n+ Student Member\n+ Trainer \n+ Assessment\n\n\n\nClearly the two member types will have common fields and methods (see below). Applying an *inheritance* design to their implementation will be rewarded with additional marks - see grading spectrum. Inheritance also applies between Trainer and Member (a Person type) which must be implemented. A visual representation of the data model is shown below: \n\n![][data]\n\nThe design detail for the classes are as follows:\n\n\n###Person\n\nFields : email, name, address and gender.  \n \nThe email is used to uniquely identify a person in the system.\n\n\n###Member \n\nSubclass of Person. \n\nFields: person’s height, starting weight, chosenPackage and a *hashmap* to record all the member's progress *i.e. assessments performed by trainers*.  \n \nThe *map key* will be the date (as a string) the assessment was performed, in the format __YY/MM/DD__, e.g. 18/05/04 (required for sorting - see later). \n\nThe *map values* will be an assessment's details - see Assessment object later.\n\n###PremiumMember \n\nSubclass of Member. Stores no additional data.\n\n\n###StudentMember \n\nSubclass of Member. Stores studentId and collegeName.\n\n###Trainer \n\nSubclass of Person. Stores the trainer’s specialty.\n\n---\n\n# Rules\nThe following rules should be applied to these entities:\n\n## Field Validation Rules\nThe following validation rules apply to these fields (fields not listed below indicates that no validation is done on them):\n\n### Height \nHeight is measured in metres and must be between 1 and 3 inclusive.\n\n### Starting Weight\nStarting Weight is measured in kgs and must be between 35 and 250.\n\n### Name\nThe name is maximum 30 characters; any name entered should be truncated to 30 characters. \n\n    \n### Gender\nThe gender can be either “M” or “F”.  If it is not either of these then apply a default value of “Unspecified”.\n\n##Class Rules\n\n+ Each class should define a **constructor** that initialises each instance fields based on user input data.\n\n+ Each class should define **accessors and mutators** for all instance fields, except for the following cases:\n\t+ Assessment hashmap (Member) - no mutator.\n\t+ Email (Person), StudentId and CollegeName (both StudentMember) - no mutators.\n\n###Specifics for class Person:\n\n+ The **Person class** should have a String **toString()** method that formats the printing of the object state and returns it. Its subclasses should override the superclass method String toString(), call the superclass toString method and also report on the new fields defined in these subclasses.\n\n\n###Specifics for class Member:\n\n+ public Assessment latestAssessment() - Returns the latest assessment based on last entry (by calendar date).\n+ public SortedSet<String> sortedAssessmentDates() - Returns the assessments dates (as strings) sorted in date order. \n+ public abstract void chosenPackage(String chosenPackage);\nThe concrete implementation of this method will be completed in Member subclasses.\n\n###Specifics for class PremiumMember:\n\n+ public void chosenPackage(String packageChoice) - Provides the concrete implementation for this method. The chosenPackage is set to the value passed as a parameter. There is no validation on the entered data.\n\n###Specifics for class StudentMember:\n\n+ public void chosenPackage(String packageChoice) - Provides the concrete implementation for this method. The chosenPackage is set to the package associated with their collegeName. If there is no package associated with their college, default to “Package 3”.\n\n###Specifics for class Assessment:\nThe last model class is Assessment. It stores weight, thigh, waist, comment and a Trainer that entered the member’s assessment (i.e. personal trainer). This class just has the standard constructor, accessor and mutator method with no validation on any fields.\n\n[data]: ./img/dataModel.jpg"

The format of the output is like so:\n\n>>>Joe Soap: xx kg (xxx lbs) x.x metres (xx inches).\n>>>Joan Soap: xx kg (xxx lbs) x.x metres (xx inches).  \n\n>>If there are no members in the gym, the message \"No registered members\" should be returned.\n\n+ public void **store**() throws Exception - Push the members and trainers array lists out to the associated XML file.\n\n\n+ public void **load**() throws Exception - Pull the members and trainers array lists from the associated XML file.\n"

    "contentMd" : "##MenuController class.\n\nThe menu driver class (**MenuController**) uses the console I/O to interact with the user. It should create an instance of the **GymApi** class and allow the user to navigate (a subset of) the system's features through a series of menus. The following processing is required in this *menu system*:\n\n1. On app start-up, automatically **load** the gym data (**trainers** and **members**) from an **XML** file.\n2. Ask the user do they want to login(l) or register (r).\n3. Ask the user if they are a member(m) or a trainer(t).\n\t+ If the user selected to **login**, verify that the email entered is stored in the appropriate arraylist i.e. the members or trainers list.  If the email doesn’t exist, print out “access denied” to the console and exit the program.\n\t+ If the user selected to **register**, ask them to enter the required details for the member/trainer. If they entered an email that is already used in the system (for either trainers/members), let them know it is an invalid email and ask them to enter a new one. \n\n4. Once logged in, display a the appropriate menu (trainer or member) for the member. \n\t+ The **trainer menu** should allow the trainer to:\n        + Add a new member \n        + List all members\n        + Search for a member by email\n        + Assessment sub-menu:\n            + Add an assessment for a member\n            + Update comment on an assessment for a member\n\t+ The **member menu** should allow the member to:\n\t\t+ View their profile\n\t\t+ Update their profile\n\t\t+ Progress sub-menu:\n\t\t\t+ View progress by weight\n\t\t\t+ View progress by waist measurement\n\n5. On app exit, automatically **save** the gym data (trainers and members) to an XML file.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n\n####Note 1:\nAside from the above requirements, the design of the menu system and the contents you include is left open to you. The qualities to aim at include user-friendliness (e.g. report progress) and robustness (e.g. validation, formatted output).\n\n####Note 2: \nThe following packages can be hard coded in this class into a HashMap:\n\n    (\"Package 1\", \"Allowed access anytime to gym.\\nFree access to all classes.\\nAccess to all changing areas including deluxe changing rooms.\");\n    \n    (\"Package 2\", \"Allowed access anytime to gym.\\n€3 fee for all classes.\\nAccess to all changing areas including deluxe changing rooms.\");\n\n    (\"Package 3\", \"Allowed access to gym at off-peak times.\n    \\n€5 fee for all classes. \\nNo access to deluxe changing rooms.\");\n    \n    (\"WIT\", \"Allowed access to gym during term time.\n    \\n€4 fee for all classes.  \\nNo access to deluxe changing rooms.\");\n\nIdeally, this data would be read in from a file, however, we can just hard-code them for the purposes of this assignment.\n\n#### Note 3:\nThe options on the progress sub-menu should ideally display the member’s progress based on the metric chosen (e.g. weight). It should display the metric sorted by date and some form of indication as to whether the subsequent measurement was above or below the previous measurement.\n"
