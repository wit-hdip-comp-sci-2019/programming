It is worth 15% of your overall grade.

(see marking scheme).\n\n"},{"title":"#Marking Scheme","shortTitle":"Marking","contentMd":"#Marking Scheme\n\nThere are two components to your overall mark:\n\n- Structure of code\n- Complexity of code\n\n*Please read below regarding **self assessment** & **interviews**.*\n\n\n##Structure of Code \"rubric\" (100 Marks)\n\nPart | Description | Marks     \n-----|-------------|-----------|\na | **Comments, indentation, naming, structure of code, includsion of Readme and Reflection.** | **(5)**\nb | **Working animation** <br> i.e. inclusion of the usual Processing class containing the draw(), setup(), etc.  | **(10)**\nc | Use of **if** statements | **(10)**\nd | Use of **loops** | **(20)**\ne | Use of at least one **bespoke method** you defined and wrote yourself <br>  e.g. eyes(), drawX().   | **(20)**\nf | Use of **Processing methods** <br> e.g. mousePressed. | **(20)**\ng | Use of **String methods** | **(15)**\n\n\n##Complexity of code (10 Marks)\n\nThis is a mark out of 10 based on the complexity of the problem solved/code. So you will get more marks if the animation is more involved than one that is very simple. Please do not confuse an elegant solution of a complex problem with a simple problem.\n\n \n##How is the final mark calculated?\n \n The final mark is calculated by multiplying the two component marks and dividing by 10. This means that complexity is a multiplier so a weakness in that will negatively affect your grade.\n\n Example:\n \n - Structure of code = 80/100\n - Complexity of code = 9/10\n - Final mark = (80 by 9)/10 = 72%\n\n\n##Interview (and subsequent grade calculation)\n\nPlease note that we reserve the right to interview you on your code via Slack video call. You *may* be asked (for example) to explain:\n\n- Any of the code.\n- How you decided on your animation.\n- How you developed your animation; where did you start first, etc?\n- Anything else.\n\nIf we need to interview you on your work, you will be given a mark out of 10 for the interview.  This mark will be a multiplier of your overall grade.  For example:\n \n - Structure of code = 80/100\n - Complexity of code = 9/10\n - Interview = 8/10\n - Final mark = (80 by 9 by 8)/100 = 57.6%\n\n"},{"title":"#Handup of submission","shortTitle":"Submission","contentMd":"#Handup of submission\n\n##Date\n\nThe submission is due ***Sunday, 17 February 2019, 11:59 PM***.\n\nNo late submissions will be accepted (unless mitigating circumstances, with supporting documentation, apply).\n\n\n##Where \n\nThe dropbox is available in the '[Assignments](https://moodle.wit.ie/course/view.php?id=132121)' section in Moodle.\n\n\n##File naming convention\n\nYour files should be contained in a **folder** named  according to the rule: \n\n- *First name* + *Second name*, e.g. Donald Duck's folder would be called *DonaldDuck*. \n\nYou should then compress (zip) the **folder** that contains all the sketches used to develop your assignment; this is the file that you should submit.\n\n\n##readme tab\n\nYou must include a readme tab in the sketch.
