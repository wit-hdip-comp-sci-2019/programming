Write the line of code that will ensure all subsequent shapes are drawn with no outline.\n\n\n##Coding the draw() method\n\nInclude the following code in your sketch:\n\n~~~\nvoid draw()\n{\n  background(204);\n  fill(255);\n  ellipse(50,50,60,60);    //outer white circle\n  fill(0);\n  ellipse(50+10, 50, 30, 30);  //black circle\n  fill(255);\n  ellipse(50+16, 46, 6, 6);  //small, white circle\n}\n~~~\n\nRun your code; a single eye should be drawn.\n\nSave your work.\n\n\n##Drawing two eyes\n\nWith your **Example_3_7** sketch open, perform a *Save as...* and enter the name **Example_3_8**.\n\nNow refactor the code above so that you have a method called **eye**.  This method should:\n \n- accept two parameters of type int, representing the x and y coordiates of the eye.\n- have a void return type.\n\nCall the eye method twice from the draw method so that your display window is rendered like so:\n\n![Two eyes](./img/00.png)\n\nSave your work.\n\n\n##Drawing six eyes\n\nWith your **Example_3_8** sketch open, perform a *Save as...* and enter the name **Example_3_9**.\n\nNow refactor the code to call the eye method six times from the draw method so that your display window is rendered like so:\n\n![Six eyes](./img/01.png)\n\nSave your work.\n\n"},{"title":"#Overloading methods","shortTitle":"02","contentMd":"#Overloading methods\n\nIn this step, you will draw many X's (the processing examples 3.10 - 3.15 from your lectures).\n\n\n##Coding the setup() method\n\nCreate a new Processing sketch in your workspace and call it **Example_3_10**.\n\nYour display window should be 100x100 and have a light grey background.  \n\n\n##Coding the drawX() method\n\nWrite a method called **drawX** that:\n\n- has a void return type\n- has an empty parameter list\n- sets the stroke to light grey\n- sets the weight of the stroke to 20\n- draws two lines that intersect in the shape of an **X**\n\nCall this method from the setup() method.\n\nWhen you run your code, it should look like this:\n\n![A light grey, heavy X](./img/02.png)\n\nSave your work.\n\n\n##Coding a second drawX() method\n\nWith your **Example_3_10** sketch open, perform a *Save as...* and enter the name **Example_3_11**.\n\nTo the existing code, write another method called **drawX** that:\n\n- has a void return type\n- accepts a parameter of type int \n- sets the stroke to the parameter\n- sets the weight of the stroke to 20\n- draws two lines that intersect in the shape of an **X**\n\nIn the setup() method, comment out the call to the previous draw method.  Now call this method instead, passing the value of 0 as a parameter.\n\nWhen you run your code, it should look like this:\n\n![A black, heavy X](./img/03.png)\n\nSave your work.\n\n\n##Coding a third drawX() method\n\nWith your **Example_3_11** sketch open, perform a *Save as...* and enter the name **Example_3_12**.\n\nTo the existing code, write another method called **drawX** that:\n\n- has a void return type\n- accepts two parameters of type int \n- sets the stroke to the first parameter\n- sets the weight of the stroke to the second parameter\n- draws two lines that intersect in the shape of an **X**\n\nIn the setup() method, comment out the call to the previous draw method.  Now call this method instead, passing the value of 0, 30 as parameters.\n\nWhen you run your code, it should look like this:\n\n![A black, really heavy X](./img/04.png)\n\nSave your work.\n\n\n##Coding a fourth drawX() method\n\nWith your **Example_3_12** sketch open, perform a *Save as...* and enter the name **Example_3_13**.\n\nWrite another method called **drawX** that:\n\n- has a void return type\n- accepts five parameters of type int \n- sets the stroke to the first parameter\n- sets the weight of the stroke to the second parameter\n- draws two lines that intersect in the shape of an **X**.  The third parameter represents X, fourth represents Y and the fifth represents the size of the line.\n\nIn the setup() method, comment out the call to the previous draw method.  Now call this method instead, passing the values:  0, 30, 40, 30, 35) as parameters.\n\nWhen you run your code, it should look like this:\n\n![A black, really heavy X](./img/05.png)\n\nSave your work.\n\n\n##Drawing multiple X's\n\nWith your **Example_3_13** sketch open, perform a *Save as...* and enter the name **Example_3_14**.\n\nUsing the most appropriate drawX method, reproduce the following output (you will have three individual method calls):\n\n![Three different X's](./img/06.png)\n\nSave your work.\n\n\n##Drawing shadowed X's\n\nWith your **Example_3_14** sketch open, perform a *Save as...* and enter the name **Example_3_15**.\n\nUsing the most appropriate drawX method and a for or while loop, reproduce the following output:\n\n![Shadowed X's](./img/07.png)\n\nSave your work.\n\n\n##Versioning Software\n\nFor our drawX project, you will notice that we now have 5 sketches, **Example_3_10** to **Example_3_15**.  This means that we have 5 different versions of the drawX project.  As we incrementally worked on our drawX project and got a new method working, we saved off that work and starting working in a new file.  This is a standard approach in programming and we will focus more on this approach throughout the course.  \n\n\n"},{"title":"#Farenheit / Celsius Converter","shortTitle":"03","contentMd":"#Farenheit / Celsius Converter\n\nIn this step, you will work on reproducing the code example 3.16 from your lectures.\n\n\n##Writing the coversion method\n\nCreate a new Processing sketch in your workspace and call it **Example_3_16**.\n\nWrite a method called **farenheitToCelsius** that takes one float parameter. \n\nThe return type for this method is **float**.\n\nThe method returns the result of the conversion:  (farenheit - 32.0) * (5.0/9.0)\n\n\n##Calling the coversion method\n\nThe **farenheitToCelsius** method should be called from the draw() method.\n\nThe value retuned from the calculation should be printed to the console.\n\nTest your code by passing the farenheit value of 451.

When the Dialog appears, enter any String of your choice.  Is the right information displayed in the JOption pane?  However, does it look very cluttered like this?
