This version will have a menu that will control the NewsFeed class.\n\n\n##Creating Network V3 Project\n\nIn IntelliJ, create a new project called Network-V3.\n\nCopy the following classes into this new project (note they have the System.out.print statements removed from them and instead have returned the Strings).\n\n- [PhotoPost](archives/v3/PhotoPost.java)\n- [MessagePost](archives/v3/MessagePost.java)\n- [Post](archives/v3/Post.java)\n- [NewsFeed](archives/v3/NewsFeed.java)\n\nCreate a new class, called Driver.  This class will contain the main() method.  In this class:\n\n- write a private method, called mainMenu() that displays the following menu and returns the user's input.\n\n![Figure 1: Menu System for NetworkV3](./img/main.png) \n\n- write a private method, called run().  This method should call the mainMenu() method and use a switch statment to process the user's input.  Hint: write a private method for each case i.e. one that creates a MessagePost, one that creates a PhotoPost and then one that adds to the posts collection.\n\n- The run() method should be called from the main method.   \n\n\n##Testing V3\n\nTest the program by doing the following:\n\n- Add 1 messagePost.\n- Add 1 photoPost.\n- Add another 1 messagePost.\n- Add another 1 photoPost.\n- List all posts.\n\n\nAre the posts printed in the order we entered them?\n\nAre all the details that we entered, displayed when we \"List all posts\"?  Why do you think details are missing?  Hint:  Investigate the code in Post, PhotoPost and MessagePost that displays the post.  *Note:  we will fix this is the next step.*\n\n\n##Solution\n\nThe solution to network-v3 is [here](archives/network-solution-v3.zip).\n\n"},{"title":"#Network-V4","shortTitle":"V4","contentMd":"#Network-V4\n\nIn this step, you will build on v3 that you wrote in the previous step.\n\n##Creating the Network-V4 project\n\nCreate a new project called Network-V4 and copy the src files from *either* your solution to network-v3 *or* our solution of [Network-V3](archives/Network-V3.zip) into it.\n  \nIn v3, details that we entered via the menu were NOT displayed back to us when we listed all posts.\n\nThe data is missing because the display method was written in the superclass, Post.  This superclass has no knowledge of its subclasses.  Therefore, it has no knowledge of the message field in MessagePost, or the filename and caption fields in the PhotoPost class. \n\nTo fix this issue, you need to also write a display method in the subclasses, MessagePost and PhotoPost.  This display method should:\n\n- override the super class method, display.\n- contain a call to the super class method, display.\n- append the sub class specific fields to the String returned from the super class call to the display method.\n\nTest your code again.  Are all details printed to the console?\n\n\n##Solution\n\nThe solution is available [here](archives/network-solution-v4.zip)\n\n"},{"title":"#Exercises","shortTitle":"Exercises","contentMd":"#Exercises\n\nThese exercises are based on the exercises in Chapter 8 of Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction Using Bluej, by David Barnes & Michael Kolling).\n\n##Exercise 1\n\nOrder the following items into an inheritance hierarchy : \n\n- Apple\n\n- IceCream\n\n- Bread\n\n- Fruit\n\n- FoodItem\n\n- Cereal\n\n- Dessert\n\n- ChocolateMousse\n\n- Baguette\n\n\n##Exercise 2\n\nAssume that we have four classes : \n\n- Person\n\n- Teacher\n\n- Student\n\n- PhDStudent\n\n\nTeacher and Student are both subclasses of Person.
