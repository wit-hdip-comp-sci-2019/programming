Call this method exercise_1.\n\n\n##Exercise 2\n\nWrite a method to read in 10 values into an integer array. Then add one to each value in the array. Finally, print out the resultant values in the array. Call this method exercise_2.\n\n\n##Exercise 3\n\nWrite a method to read in 10 ‘wages’ into a ‘double’ array (i.e. an array where each element is a double, for instance 2.33). Finally print out these values. Call this method exercise_3.\n\n\n##Exercise 4\n\nWrite a method to Similar to above , i.e. read in 10 ‘wages’ into a ‘double’ array (i.e. an array where each element is a double, for instance 2.33). This time only print out any wages over 100. Call this exercise_4.\n\n\n##Exercise 5\n\nSimilar to above, i.e. Read in 10 ‘wages’ into a ‘double’ array (i.e. an array where each element is a double, for instance 2.33). Anyone who earns over 1000 will have a wage reduction of 10%. Make this reduction. Finally print out all the values. Call this method exercise_5.\n\n\n##Exercise 6\n\nWrite a method to read in 10 'wages' into a 'double' array as above. Calculate and print the average of the inputted wages.  Call this method exercise_6.\n\n\n"},{"title":"#Solution","shortTitle":"Solution","contentMd":"#Solution\n\nThe solution to these exercises [is here](archives/ArrayExercises.zip).\n\n\n"}]}
