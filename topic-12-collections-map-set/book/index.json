Tell me more…”**\n\n\n\n##Tech Support 2\n\nCreate a new project in IntelliJ and call it **Tech Support V2**.\n\nCopy the java files from **Tech Support V1** into **Tech Support V2**.\n\nMake the necessary changes to this project so that the system provides a random response from a list of pre-defined responses e.g.:\n\n- \"That sounds interesting. Tell me more...\"\n\n- \"I need a bit more information on that.\"\n\n- \"Have you checked that you do not have a dll conflict?\"\n\n- \"That is explained in the manual. Have you read the manual?“\n\n- \" That's not a bug, it's a feature!\"\n\n- \"Could you elaborate on that?“\n\n- etc.\n\n\nUse your lecture notes to support you in this task.\n\nTest your completed app to make sure it behaves as expected.\n\n\n"
