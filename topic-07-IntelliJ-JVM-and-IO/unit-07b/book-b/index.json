At the moment, we won’t be \nusing them, so click on the button to **Skip Remaining and Set Defaults**.  \n\nIntelliJ shoud now startup.\n\n![](./img/ide12.PNG)\n\n\n##Creating your first Java Program\n\nClick **Create New Project**.\n\n![](./img/ide13.PNG)\n\nSomething similar to this window should appear:\n\n![](./img/ide14.PNG)\n\nIf your installation says that **No SDK** exists for the **Project SDK** (as ours does above), click on the **New..** button and locate the version of Java you previously downloaded, for example:\n\n![](./img/ide15.PNG)\n\nNow that we have a valid Project SDK, click the **Next** button.  \n\nMake sure the **Create project from template** box is unchecked and click the Next button:\n\nEnter the project name as **HelloWorld** and click **Finish**.\n\n![](./img/ide16.PNG)\n\nClose the **Tip** window when it appears.  \n\nYou should now have an empty project:\n\n![](./img/ide17.PNG)\n\nRight click on the *src* folder and select *New* followed by *Java Class*.\n\n![](./img/ide18.PNG)\n\nWhen the dialog appears, enter **Main** as the class name.  You now should have an empty class like this:\n\n![](./img/ide19.PNG)\n\nAdd the following code to the empty **Main** class:\n\n~~~java\npublic static void main(String args[])\n{\n\tSystem.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\n}\n~~~\n\nOur first project has now been created and it contains a **Main.java** file with Java code in it.\n\n![](./img/ide20.PNG)\n\n\n##Running your first Java Program\n\nThis program, when run, will print **Hello World!** into the console window.  \n\nTo run the program, click on the green triangle beside the main method.\nThen select *Run ‘Main.main()’*:\n\n![](./img/ide21.PNG)\n\n**Hello World!** should be printed to the console:\n\n![](./img/ide22.PNG)\n\nIf you are not getting this result, you should flag this to your instructor who can help diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n"

The details of the product will be printed back to the user. \n\n- During this step, you may need to view this weeks lecture notes to remind you how to write classes.\n\n- In IntelliJ, create a new Java Project called **ShopV1.0**.\n\n- Within this project, create two new Classes; **Product** and **Driver**.\n\n- Your folder structure should look like this:\n\n![ShopV1.0 folder structure](./img/17.PNG)\n\n\n##Product Class\n\nIn the Product class, create four private instance fields:\n\n- productName of type String\n- productCode of type int\n- unitCost of type double\n- inCurrentProductLine of type boolean\n\nWrite a constructor for this class that takes the four instance fields as parameters and updates the object state using these parameters.  Note: no need for field validation yet.\n\nWrite a getter for each instance field.  \n\nWrite a setter for each instance field.  Note: no need for field validation yet.\n\nWrite a toString method that builds and returns a String comprising a user friendly representation of the object state.\n\n\n##Driver Class\n\nIn the Driver class, create two private instance fields:\n\n- input of type Scanner (initialise this field using **new Scanner(System.in)**) \n- product of type Product\n\nWrite a method called **addProduct()** that asks the user to input the details of the product (name, code, unit cost and whether or not it is in the current product line).  Use this data to create a new Product object i.e.\n\n~~~java\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the Product Name:  \");\n        String productName = input.nextLine();\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the Product Code:  \");\n        int productCode = input.nextInt();\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the Unit Cost:  \");\n        double unitCost = input.nextDouble();\n        System.out.print(\"Is this product in your current line (y/n): \");\n        char currentProduct = input.next().charAt(0);\n        boolean inCurrentProductLine = false;\n        if ((currentProduct == 'y') || (currentProduct == 'Y'))\n            inCurrentProductLine = true;\n        \n        product = new Product(productName, productCode, unitCost, inCurrentProductLine);\n~~~\n\nWrite a method called **printProduct()** that prints all the product to the console.  Hint: use the toString() method from the Product class.\n\nWrite a **main** method that has the following code:\n\n~~~java\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\tDriver c = new Driver();\n\t\tc.addProduct();\n\t\tc.printProduct();\n  }\n~~~\n\n\n##Run the App\n\nRun the app; does all work as expected?

It should accept one parameter of type **int**.\n\nThis method interrogates the parameter value and prints the type of angle it is to the screen (according to the screen shots above).\n\n\n##Run the App\n\nRun the app; does all work as expected?\n\n\n"
