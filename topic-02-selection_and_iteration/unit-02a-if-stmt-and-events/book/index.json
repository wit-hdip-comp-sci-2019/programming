When the mouse is released and dragged, no circles should be drawn.\n\n\n##Exercise 2\n\n- Create a display window of 500x400, with a black background.\n\n- When the LEFT mouse button is pressed, draw a red circle (50 pixel diameter) with a white outline.  Note:  when this button is pressed and dragged, multiple circles should be drawn.\n\n- When the RIGHT mouse button is pressed, draw a blue square (length of 50 pixels) with a white outline.  Note:  when this button is pressed and dragged, multiple squares should be drawn.\n\n- When no button is pressed and the mouse is dragged, nothing should be drawn.\n\n\n##Exercise 3\n\n- Draw circles (diameter 100) as the mouse is moved (the background should not be cleared).\n\n- When the mouse is pressed, reduce the size of the circle by 10 pixels.  \n\n- When the circle diameter reaches 50 pixels, don't reduce it anymore.\n\n\n##Exercise 4\n\n- Draw circles (diameter 100) as the mouse is moved (the background should not be cleared).\n\n- As each circle is drawn, its colour should vary from the previous one (use mathematical calculations on your RBG colours).\n \n- Make sure you **boundary** test this exercise.  What we mean by that is...test what happens when your colour reaches 0 or when it reaches 255.  Does it reset itself and cycle through the colours again or does it get stuck drawing in only one colour?\n\n\n"

Can you enter a lower case **c** to draw a circle?\n\n\n##Challenge 3\n\n- In a new sketch, draw a vertical line that is the height of your display window.\n\n- This vertical line should start in the left most position of your display window and move right, pixel by pixel, until it reaches the right hand side of your display window.  \n\n- Upon reaching the right hand side, the vertical line should reverse direction and return, pixel by pixel, to the left hand side of the display window.\n\n- As your vertical line is continually traversing the display window, your grayscale background should be varying very slightly in colour.  \n\n\n"
